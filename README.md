Project Overview

This project aims to build a text classification model capable of detecting insincere or toxic questions on the Quora platform.
The model automatically classifies whether a question is Sincere (0) or Insincere (1) using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques

Project Description

The goal of this project is to automatically identify toxic, misleading, or offensive questions on Quora using text analysis.
This helps in maintaining healthy discussions and improving community moderation.

Key Objectives:

Preprocess text data (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal)

Convert text into numerical form using TF-IDF Vectorization

Train ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Light Neural Network)

Evaluate performance using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score

Visualize results with confusion matrices and feature importance graphs

Technologies Used

Python 3.8+

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

NLTK

Seaborn, Matplotlib

Joblib
Future Enhancements

Use BERT / LSTM for deeper contextual understanding

Train with a larger real-world Quora dataset

Deploy as a web app or API for automatic question moderation
