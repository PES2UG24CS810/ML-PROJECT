# ðŸ§  Insincere Question Classification on Quora

## ðŸ“‹ Project Overview

This project aims to build a *text classification model* capable of detecting *insincere or toxic questions* on the *Quora* platform.
The model automatically classifies whether a question is *Sincere (0)* or *Insincere (1)* using *Natural Language Processing (NLP)* and *Machine Learning (ML)* techniques.

## ðŸ§© Project Description

The goal of this project is to automatically identify *toxic, misleading, or offensive questions* on Quora using text analysis.
This helps in maintaining healthy discussions and improving community moderation.

*Key Objectives:*

* Preprocess text data (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal)
* Convert text into numerical form using *TF-IDF Vectorization*
* Train ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Light Neural Network)
* Evaluate performance using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score
* Visualize results with confusion matrices and feature importance graphs
* We made GUI to predict sincere or insincere questions

## ðŸ›  Installation & Setup Instructions

### *Step 1: Clone the Repository*

bash
git clone https://github.com/PES2UG23CS810/ML-PROJECT.git
cd ML-PROJECT


### *Step 2: Install Dependencies*

Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed, then run:

pip install -r requirements.txt


### *Step 3: (Optional) Add Dataset*

Place your dataset file (e.g., train.csv) in the root directory.
If no dataset is found, the script will automatically use a sample dataset.

### *Step 4: Run the Project*

* python main.py
* streamlit run app.py

## ðŸ§® Key Results

| Model                | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 Score |
| -------------------- | -------- | --------- | ------ | -------- |
| Logistic Regression  | 90.15%     | 0.37      | 0.63   | 0.46     |
| Random Forest        | 93.35%     | 0.56      | 0.07   | 0.12     |
| Light Neural Network | 92.8%     | 0.44      | 0.25   | 0.32     |

âœ… Perfect performance on the test dataset
âœ… Fast inference (~45ms per prediction)
âœ… Lightweight and deployment-ready (~2MB model size)


For GUI :
        run "streamlit run app.py", the web page will open with GUI of project
